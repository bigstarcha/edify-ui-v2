# Edify UI

## An Overview

This repository contains the frontend code for Edify, a Christian social media web application. Edify is written in TypeScript, uses Next.js as its framework, and its components are styled with Tailwind utility classes.

This is a passion project that I am working on that not only allows me to practice my frontend skills, but also to hopefully create an MVP that can evolve into a full-fledged app that promotes online fellowship across Christians and non-Christians alike.
